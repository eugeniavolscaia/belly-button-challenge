# belly-button-challenge

     With this assignment was built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset,
     which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
     The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, 
     or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

     The app file has been deployed to GitHub Pages.
